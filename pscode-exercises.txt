// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers


Print ("Enter two integers: ")
INPUT A, B
SUM = A + B
Print ("The sum of the numbers is: ", SUM)



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Print ("Enter a Number: ")
INPUT num


IF oddeven % 2 = 0
  print ("The number entered is Even")
ELSE
  print ("The number entered is Odd")            



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are



Print ("Enter 5 integers: ")

INPUT n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

SUM = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)
AVERAGE SUM/5


MINI = n1
MAXI = n1

FOR x = 2 to 5:
   IF n1 > nx 
       MINI = nx
   ELSE IF n1 < nx:
       MAXI = nx

print("The average of the numbers entered is:", AVERAGE)
print("The smallest of then numbers entered is:", MINI)
print("The largest of the numbers entered is:", MAXI)
